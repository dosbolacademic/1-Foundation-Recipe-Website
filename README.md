# Foundation Recipe Website
A simple yet functional recipe website built entirely with HTML. This project features an index page that links to multiple traditional recipe pages, allowing easy navigation between different dishes.

The goal of this project is to practice HTML structure and internal linking while creating a personal collection of favorite recipes that I can easily access whenever I want to cook at home.

This project is intentionally built without CSS—keeping it pure HTML for fun and learning while strengthening my HTML skills. 🚀🍽️ [Click Here](https://dosbolacademic.github.io/1-Foundation-Recipe-Website/index.html)
