    <p>Juicy, flavorful dumplings filled with seasoned meat and onions, wrapped in delicate dough, and steamed to perfection.  
       <strong>Manty</strong> are a staple of Kyrgyz cuisine, best served with sour cream, vinegar, or a side of garlic yogurt sauce.</p>
    <p>Traditionally cooked in a <strong>manty steamer</strong>, these dumplings are the ultimate comfort food. Some say the secret to the best Manty is 
       making the dough <strong>as thin as a silk scarf</strong> and chopping the meat <strong>by hand for maximum tenderness</strong></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Dough:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup water (warm, not boiling)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 egg (optional, for elasticity)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground lamb or beef (or mix both for extra richness)</li>
        <li>2 large onions, finely chopped (for juiciness!)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin (a must-have spice!)</li>
        <li>½ tsp coriander</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter or lamb fat (for added moisture)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recipe Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix flour, salt, and warm water to form a smooth dough. Let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>

        <li>Roll out the dough thinly and cut it into <strong>4-inch squares or circles</strong>.</li>
        <li>Place a generous spoonful of filling in the center of each dough piece.</li>
        <li>Fold and pinch the edges together, sealing them into a traditional Manty shape.</li>
        <li>Arrange the Manty in a <strong>steamer</strong>, ensuring they don’t touch.</li>
        <li>Steam for about <strong>40-45 minutes</strong> until fully cooked.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with sour cream, yogurt, or a drizzle of vinegar.</li>
    </ol>
